## 1 Environment configuration
1. computer with GPU
2. python	
	* numpy	
	* scipy	
	* tensorflow	
	* matplotlib	
## 2	Test data
  * The test data is given in data/input, 
  * The direct signal and first-order reflections are pre-extracted, as well as the room geometry and sound source localization.`
  * In each .mat file, data.ref_sig refers to 7-channel direct and reflected signals; data.dir_sig1 refers to the sound source signal. 
## 3 Run` 
  * The PMSSL model is conducted using the pre-trained U-net in [model/enhance-Unet-22-6-4/](https://disk.pku.edu.cn:443/link/5B58574058E6EF47A023BA3EF5018A36
)ï¼ŒDownload and place it in the root directory. 
  * run c_train_with_phy_model.py
